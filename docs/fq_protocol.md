# fq Protocol

## Client

Clients maintain two paired tcp connections to fq. After the connections are made, some preliminary data is sent over the command socket. A "plain auth" command is then issued, return a client key. The client key is then used in some preliminary data sent over the data socket, pairing the two sockets for the session.

### Prefixes

* Cmd Mode: `0xcc50cafe`
* Data Mode: `0xcc50face`
* Peer Mode: `0xcc50fade`

### Command Socket

    Length   | Description
    ---------+-----------------------------
    4 bytes  | Cmd Mode

### Data Socket

    Length   | Description
    ---------+-----------------------------
    4 bytes  | Data Mode
    2 bytes  | Client Key Length
    variable | Client Key

## Commands

General form `(command prefix)(command)`, big endian. All non-heartbeat related commands have in-band responses corresponding to the order in which requests they were sent to fq. Heartbeat requests are used simply to tell fq to look for and to send heartbeats at a specific interval. Heartbeats should be checked for during normal command processing and not as a response to a specific request.

### Prefixes

Commad prefixes are two bytes at the beginning of the command

* Error: `0xeeee`
* Heartbeat: `0xbea7`
* Auth CMD: `0xaaaa`
* Auth Plain: `0x0000`
* Auth Response: `0xaa00`
* Heartbeat Request: `0x4848`
* Bind: `0xb171`
* Bind Request: `0xb170`
* Unbind: `0x171b`
* Unbind Request: `0x071b`
* Status: `0x57a7`
* Status Request: `0xc7a7`

#### Plain Auth 

Plain Auth is a subset of Auth and will have both prefixs

    variable | Program

##### Response

    Length   | Description
    ---------+-----------------------------
    2 bytes  | Bind Prefix
    4 bytes  | Binding ID

#### Unbind

##### Request

    Length   | Description
    ---------+-----------------------------
    2 bytes  | Unbind Request Prefix
    4 bytes  | Binding ID
    2 bytes  | Exchange Length
    variable | Exchange

##### Response

    Length   | Description
    ---------+-----------------------------
    2 bytes  | Unbind Prefix
    4 bytes  | Binding ID

On success, the response binding id will be the same as the one sent in the request.

#### Status

##### Request

    Length   | Description
    ---------+-----------------------------
    2 bytes  | Status Request Prefix

##### Response

    Length   | Description
    ---------+-----------------------------
    2 bytes  | Status Prefix

    variable | Key
    4 bytes  | Value
    â€¦ (repeat key length, key, value sets)
    2 bytes  | Key Length 0

The response contains serveral key-value pairs. Each key is prefixed by a length and parsing of kv pairs should continue until a key length of 0 is read.
