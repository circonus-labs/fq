# fq.

fq is a *brokered* message queue using a publish subscribe model.  It is architected for performance and isn't (today) designed for large numbers of connected clients.

## Terminology

### Broker

The `fqd` process. The deamon through which all knowledge passes.

### Client

A client is an applications connection to fq over TCP/IP to send or receive messages. A client makes two TCP/IP connections to fq.  An application can present itself to fq as multiple clients at one time (by opening new pairs of connections). See Queues for reasons why.

### Exchanges

Exchanges are like buses on which messages may be sent.  You cannot send a message without doing so on an exchange.  Exchanges are created within fq on-demand.

### Queues

Queues are queues. If you stick something in one end, you should expect it to come out the other.  A single queue may have multiple clients subscribed.  When a client connects, it is attached to one and only one queue.  If an application wishes to attach to more than one queue, it should present as multiple clients.  Queues use a competitive consumption model meaning that if multiple clients are attached to a single queue, the messages send to that queue will be distributed over the clients such that no two clients will see the same message.

### Routes

Routes define how messages send on exchange are placed in queues.

### Messages

Messages are, of course, a payload and metadata.

#### Message metadata

Some are set by the broker.
 
 * sender [set by the broker]
 * hops (a list of fqd via which the message passed)

Others are set by the sender. 

 * exchange (up to 127 bytes)
 * route (up to 127 bytes)
 * id (128 bits). The first 64 bits the sender shall control, the latter 64bits the broker *might* control.
